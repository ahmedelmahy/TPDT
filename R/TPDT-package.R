#' TPDT
#'
#' The package provides the necessary tools to compute a TPDT for a general dataset.
#' The data required are paired, time-resloved observations. The output of the statistical test
#' allows to decide whether there are significant differences between both groups and to quantify
#' the impact of those differences. The package is extended by generic functions which may be
#' applied on the computed test object and help visualize the test results. Additionally a
#' function which allows to sample random curves around a given smooth curve and a cross
#' validation function are presented to the user.
